Java does not support pointers explicitly like C/C++.

Reasons:
1. Security

Pointers can access any memory location

This may lead to:

Data corruption

Illegal memory access

Java avoids this to be secure (important for web & enterprise apps)

2. Simplicity

Pointer arithmetic (*, &, ++) is confusing for beginners

Java was designed to be easy to learn and use

3. Automatic Memory Management

Java has Garbage Collector

Developers don’t need to:

Allocate memory manually

Free memory manually

Pointers would break this mechanism

4. No Pointer Arithmetic

Java references cannot be incremented or decremented

This avoids bugs like:

Dangling pointers

Memory leaks

 Important note:

 Java uses references internally, but does not allow pointer operations
